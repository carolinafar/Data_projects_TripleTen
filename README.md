## üß† Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction (Final Project)

*Goal:*  
Predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on their contract, personal, and internet service data.

*Description:*  
Developed a machine learning model using Python to identify at-risk clients for the telecom company Interconnect.  
By forecasting churn, the company can target customers with retention offers and reduce revenue loss.

*Key Techniques:*
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluation using *AUC-ROC = 0.84* and *Accuracy metrics*  
- Insights visualized through correlation analysis and feature importance plots  

*Tools Used:*  
Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost), Jupyter Notebook

## üõ¢Ô∏è Project 2: Machine Learning in Business ‚Äî OilyGiant Oil Well Analysis

Goal:
Identify the most profitable region for drilling new oil wells based on geological data and predictive modeling.

Description:
Built a linear regression model to estimate oil reserves across three regions for the mining company OilyGiant.
Using predictions of potential well output, the project evaluates expected profit and financial risk through bootstrapping, helping the company choose the most optimal investment area.

Key Techniques:

Data preparation and feature analysis

Linear regression modeling per region

Profit estimation with business constraints

Risk assessment using bootstrapping (1,000 samples)

Decision-making based on confidence intervals and loss probability

*_Tools Used:_*
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook
