## ðŸ§  Project 1: Customer Churn Prediction (Final Project)

*Goal:*  
Predict whether a telecom customer is likely to churn based on their contract, personal, and internet service data.

*Description:*  
Developed a machine learning model using Python to identify at-risk clients for the telecom company Interconnect.  
By forecasting churn, the company can target customers with retention offers and reduce revenue loss.

*Key Techniques:*
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model comparison: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost  
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning  
- Evaluation using *AUC-ROC = 0.84* and *Accuracy metrics*  
- Insights visualized through correlation analysis and feature importance plots  

*Tools Used:*  
Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost), Jupyter Notebook
